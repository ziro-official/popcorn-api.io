        # Popcorn Is Using WebTorrent!

        # What is WebTorrent?

        **WebTorrent** is a streaming torrent client for the **web browser** and the **desktop**.

        WebTorrent is written completely in JavaScript – the language of the web –
        and uses **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer transport whenever possible. No
        browser plugins, extensions, or installation is required to use WebTorrent
        in your browser.

        ## Why?

        Imagine a peer-to-peer YouTube where viewers help to host the site's
        content. By making BitTorrent easier to use, we can get more people to
        participate and take the first steps to re-decentralizing the Internet.

        ## How do I try it out?

        See WebTorrent in action on the Web at [Instant.io](https://instant.io).
        Send a file to a friend using BitTorrent!

        Or, install [Popcorn Desktop](/desktop) for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
        Try out a fast, lightweight, new torrent client today!
